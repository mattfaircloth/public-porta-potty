# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 20.times do
# 	  User.create(username: Faker::Name.name, password_digest: Faker::Name.initials)
#     Bathroom.create(name: Faker::Food.dish + " Store", cleanliness: rand(1...10))
#     Location.create(address: Faker::Address.street_address, neighborhood: Faker::Address.city)
#
# 	end
#
#
# 	50.times do
#     @user = User.all.sample.bathrooms << Bathroom.all.sample
#     @bathroom = Bathroom.all.sample.locations << Location.all.sample
